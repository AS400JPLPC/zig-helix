**ENSCRIPT**  
  
install pacman -S enscript

software   
the _enscript_ command changes a text file to PostScript format and then sends it to the printer.

I use it to list my source files

Zig not being recognized, I created the “zig.st” module and added the zig recognition line to “enscript.st”.  
 

I put the procedure update\_Enscript.sh, which you must use with sudo or pkexec.  
 

It's complicated for me to ask to include the module, I only speak English, only with Google
